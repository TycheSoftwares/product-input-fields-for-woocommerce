[**Product Input Fields for WooCommerce**](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/store/premium-plugins/product-input-fields-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=topprolink&utm_campaign=ProductInputFields) plugin lets you add custom input fields to WooCommerce product's frontend for customer to fill before adding product to cart.

Input fields can be added **globally** (i.e. for all products) or on **per product** basis.

You can choose numerous different **types** for fields:

* Text
* Textarea
* Number
* Checkbox
* Color
* File
* Datepicker
* Weekpicker
* Timepicker
* Select
* Radio
* Password
* Country
* Email
* Phone
* Search
* URL
* Range

Each type comes with specific **options** you can set for each field.

Additionally you can set fields **HTML template** and much more.

Plugin is limited to adding two input fields to each product - one (global) field for all products and one more (local) for each product individually. If you wish to add unlimited number of global and/or local product input fields, please check our [Product Input Fields for WooCommerce Pro](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/store/premium-plugins/product-input-fields-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=prolink&utm_campaign=ProductInputFields) plugin.
